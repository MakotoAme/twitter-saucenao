# Our stance on crediting artists
**Please be aware that attempting to block SauceBot may result in the bot automatically contacting the original artists with DMCA takedown instructions for your posts.**

Providing artists with credit is not something we believe should be considered optional. Furthermore, attempting to deny original artists credit is toxic behavior and we will act within our power to deplatform accounts which actively work to deny original artists the credit they are entitled to.

Furthermore, please remember that it takes a long time to create a work of art and the amount of time and effort these artists put into their art is nothing compared to the amount of time needed to credit them with a simple hyperlink

# Closing remarks
Thatâ€™s about it! I hope you have found this project useful. All the major credit really goes to the SauceNao website and service, which allows the bot to operate.

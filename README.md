A fork of FujiMakoto's open-source Twitter bot that aims to monitor, and help take down accounts that refuse to give credit to the artist of an artwork.

# Requests for account monitoring
You can ask us to monitor an account with our bot to automatically provide sauce to any artwork it posts! Just raise and issue here or [DM us in Twitter!](https://twitter.com/findsaucepls)

Help us provide credits to the original artists and take down art thieves!

# Why Saucefinder when there is SauceBot?
The main role of Saucefinder is to find accounts that constantly post anime art without crediting the artist and provide credit whether they like it or not. When Saucefinder is blocked, we do our very best to stop the account not only through a DMCA complaint, but also sending a complaint to Twitter explaining what they are doing and why they should be deactivated. In other words, Saucefinder is a an aggressive, dedicated bot that aims to lead the campaign against art theivery and lack of credit to artists.

SauceBot can do those things mentioned and at the same time, SauceBot has increased API limits in SauceNAO and the servers it is on which means it is able to cater to requests. Saucefinder has standard API limits both for Twitter and SauceNAO which is why it is dedicated to policing the anime artworks in Twitter by providing sauce to monitored accounts rather than accepting single sauce requests. There is also a significant downtime for Saucefinder when I turn off my netbook (yes, netbook since this is just a free, no-funds side project.) 

# Our stance on crediting artists
We know that there are people that are very stubborn in crediting artists so we are engaging in an aggressive campaign where we try to credit photos to the limit of our SauceNAO API limit (200 per day) whether we are officially endorsed by a Twitter account or not. 

__Crediting artists in reposting art is a REQUIREMENT and NOT an option.__

**Please be aware that attempting to block Saucefinder may result in the bot automatically contacting the original artists with DMCA takedown instructions for your posts and may possibly result in the deletion of your account.**

> "Providing artists with credit is not something we believe should be considered optional. Furthermore, attempting to deny original artists credit is toxic behavior and we will act within our power to deplatform accounts which actively work to deny original artists the credit they are entitled to."

Furthermore, please remember that it takes a long time to create a work of art and the amount of time and effort these artists put into their art is nothing compared to the amount of time needed to credit them with a simple hyperlink.

# Closing remarks by Sean Ernest
This fork was made possible by FujiMakoto and SauceNAO so please support them in their projects! Please direct technical issues to the [original repository](https://github.com/FujiMakoto/twitter-saucenao) as I have zero experience in code.

Also, if you want to debate about the issue of crediting artists in art reposts, I am more than willing to debate with you through a live debate in a social media platform of your choice! Just raise an issue here or [DM me in Twitter!](https://twitter.com/seeaannuu) (^o^)

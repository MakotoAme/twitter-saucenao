# twitter-saucenao

Previously an open-source Twitter bot that utilized the SauceNao API to find the source of images or anime screencaps.

Due to pricing changes with the Twitter API, it is no longer feasible to run an instance of this bot. Even with a paid API tier, bots of this nature utilize way too many API requests to remain functional at scale.


# Documentation

Setting up your own instance of the Twitter SauceNao bot is pretty straightforward. All you need to do is copy the
example configuration file, [
config.example.ini](https://github.com/FujiMakoto/twitter-saucenao/blob/master/config.example.ini), to **config.ini**,
then set the configuration variables accordingly.

# Closing remarks

I hope you have found this project useful. All the major credit really goes to the SauceNao website and service, which
allows the bot to operate.

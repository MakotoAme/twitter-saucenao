# Official Twitter account

Support for the official Twitter account has been discontinued. The platform provides no way to scale bots that need more than 2,400 tweets/day. I've tried to work around this repeatedly to no avail.

## (05/11/2021) Shadowbans and DMCA abuse

Many legitimate artist accounts on Twitter are being closed because of false/malicious copyright complaints by bad actors attempting to blackmail these people into paying them to regain access to their account.

Examples:

* https://twitter.com/RyaiArt/status/1364745241350316032

Legitimate artist accounts are being closed with only a handful of false DMCA complaints being filed against them.

At the same time, Twitter is actively refusing to take action against accounts which only exist to steal other peopleâ€™s
art and try to profit off it.

Our hands-on experience shows legitimate artists trying to protect their own intellectual property must file up to **30
or more** separate DMCA reports against actual bad actors to get any action taken.

On top of all this, as soon as we started offering a service to help these artists submit takedowns against art thieves,
Twitter placed a shadowban on our account in an attempt to prevent us from maintaining contact with these artists.

**If you are an artist and you have been falsely banned by Twitter over malicious DMCA strikes, please contact me on here. I will do everything in my power to help you recover your account without needing to expose your personal information to any nefarious parties attempting to extort you.**

I hope you have found this project useful. All the major credit really goes to the SauceNao website and service, which

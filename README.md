# Our stance on crediting artists
We know that there are people that are very stubborn in crediting artists so we are engaging in an aggressive campaign where we try to credit photos to the limit of our SauceNAO API limit (200 per day) whether we are officially endorsed by a Twitter account or not. __Crediting artists in reposting art is a REQUIREMENT and NOT an option.__

**Please be aware that attempting to block Saucefinder may result in the bot automatically contacting the original artists with DMCA takedown instructions for your posts and may possibly result in the deletion of your account.**

> "Providing artists with credit is not something we believe should be considered optional. Furthermore, attempting to deny original artists credit is toxic behavior and we will act within our power to deplatform accounts which actively work to deny original artists the credit they are entitled to."

Furthermore, please remember that it takes a long time to create a work of art and the amount of time and effort these artists put into their art is nothing compared to the amount of time needed to credit them with a simple hyperlink.

# Closing remarks by Satoshi
This fork was made possible by FujiMakoto and SauceNAO so please support them in their projects! Please direct technical issues to the [original repository](https://github.com/FujiMakoto/twitter-saucenao) as I have zero experience in code.

Also, if you want to debate about the issue of crediting artists in art reposts, I am more than willing to debate with you through a live debate in a social media platform of your choice! Just raise an issue here or [DM me in Twitter!](https://twitter.com/satoshi_140) (^-^)

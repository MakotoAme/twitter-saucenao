# Frequently Asked Questions

**Q:** How does SauceBot work?

**A:** SauceBot works primarily through a service called [SauceNao](https://saucenao.com/), owned and operated by Xamayon. Not only that, but we also integrate with various other services, such as Pixiv, trace.moe and yuna.moe to provide more detailed information! You can find a full list of what services we use on our [credits](https://github.com/FujiMakoto/twitter-saucenao/blob/master/CREDITS.md) page.

**Q:** Is SauceBot affiliated with SauceNao?

**A:** No. This is an entirely unofficial project that is not directly affiliated with SauceNao in any way. I just write the bot software and manage a library that interacts with SauceNao's public API, but I have no hand in the amazing work Xamayon does himself.

**Q:** Why can't you find the source of <insert random image>?

**A:** I am a bot, and unfortunately machines aren't perfect! I do my best to keep things tuned and only provide accurate results, but unfortunately services such as SauceNao are easily tripped up by things like awkward crops, black bars and so on. It's also possible whatever you are requesting simply doesn't exist in any of SauceNao's databases.

**Q:** Does SauceNao work for non-anime related things?

**A:** Yes, no, and not really. In short, any artwork that's on Pixiv SauceBot does a very good job of finding. Anime and H-Anime screencaps are also usually always successful as well, assuming they aren't weirdly cropped. Manga lookups are also supported, but if the panels are cropped too much, they won't work. For artwork not on Pixiv, SauceNao does also have some support for deviantArt, and can also scrape Booru sites and provide source links that way.

Technically, there is also limited support for TV shows and Movies, but this is not the bots intended purpose and you shouldn't expect good results when using it this way.

**Q:** Isn't this a bot? Why does it seem like an actual human is posting sometimes?

**A:** SauceBot _is_ a bot, but sometimes I'll post development updates and respond to specific questions or try and address complaints people may have in comments. Sometimes I also just like to post some silly stuff for fun and interact with the bots audience, but I try and keep that to a minimum!
